Game where you have to find an hyperbolic component of the Mandelbrot set based on a plot of its neighborhood.

The code was adapted from [my package to study complex dynamical systems](https://github.com/vambrosi/FracPy).

Clone this repository and install numpy, matplotlib, and numba.

Then, run the following command in its root directory:
```
python ./guessr.py
```
